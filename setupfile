🚀 Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to deploy the SIEM lab and reproduce the detection results.
1. Prerequisites

    Docker & Docker Compose installed.

    Kali Linux (or any Linux VM) with ssh and hydra installed.

2. Deploy the SIEM Stack

Navigate to the directory containing your docker-compose.yml and run:
Bash

docker-compose up -d

    This will launch Elasticsearch on port 9200 and Kibana on port 5601.

    Wait about 1-2 minutes for the services to initialize. Access the dashboard at http://localhost:5601.

3. Configure Log Collection (Filebeat)

    Move the filebeat.yml to your Kali Linux machine.

    Install Filebeat and start the service:

Bash

sudo filebeat modules enable system
sudo filebeat setup
sudo service filebeat start

    This begins shipping auth.log data to your Elasticsearch instance.

4. Import Detection Logic

To see the alerts and dashboards I created:

    In Kibana, go to Stack Management > Saved Objects.

    Click Import and select the .ndjson files from the /configs folder.

    Go to Security > Rules and ensure the "LAB - Local SSH Brute Force" rule is enabled.

5. Reproduce the Attack

Run the following command in your terminal to trigger the detection rule:
Bash

hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 127.0.0.1 ssh -s 22 -t 4

    Note: Ensure you have unzipped rockyou.txt.gz before running.

6. Verify Results

    Open the "SSH Brute Force Attack Timeline" dashboard in Kibana.

    You should see a real-time spike in the Count of records graph, confirming the attack was detected.
